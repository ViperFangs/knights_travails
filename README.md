# knights_travails

Created as part of [The Odin Project Curriculum](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-knights-travails).

## Project

The task is to build a function knight_moves that shows the shortest possible way to get from one square on the chess board to another by outputting all squares the knight will stop on along the way.

## Expected Output

\> knight_moves([3,3],[4,3])
\n=> You made it in 3 moves!  Here's your path:
  \n[3,3]
  \n[4,5]
  \n[2,4]
  \n[4,3]
